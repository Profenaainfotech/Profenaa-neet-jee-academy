  <div class="card reveal">
    <h3>1. Exam Purpose & Conducting Body</h3>
    <p><b>JEE Main</b> is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) and serves two major purposes: 
      acting as the gateway for admissions into NITs, IIITs, and GFTIs, and functioning as the qualifying exam for JEE Advanced.</p>
    <p><b>JEE Advanced</b> is conducted by the IITs on a rotational basis, aimed exclusively at selecting the top-performing students 
      for admissions into the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).</p>
    <p>Only the top 2.5 lakh rankers from JEE Main are eligible to attempt JEE Advanced, showcasing its elite-level filtering.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card reveal">
    <h3>2. Difficulty Level</h3>
    <p><b>JEE Main Difficulty:</b> Questions are largely NCERT-based with moderate conceptual depth. 
      The exam tests speed, accuracy, and fundamental understanding rather than complex problem-solving.</p>
    <p><b>JEE Advanced Difficulty:</b> Considered one of the toughest undergraduate exams in the world. 
      It demands deep analytical thinking, application of multiple concepts in a single question, and advanced problem-solving ability.</p>
    <p>Students preparing for IITs must focus on higher-order thinking and exceptional conceptual clarity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card reveal">
    <h3>3. Exam Pattern & Question Type</h3>
    <p><b>JEE Main Pattern:</b> Contains predictable question types such as MCQs and numerical-value questions. 
      The marking scheme is straightforward, making exam strategy easier for students.</p>
    <p><b>JEE Advanced Pattern:</b> The pattern changes every year and may include:
      <ul>
        <li>Single & multi-correct MCQs</li>
        <li>Matrix match</li>
        <li>Numerical-type questions</li>
        <li>Partial marking questions</li>
      </ul>
      This unpredictability makes Advanced more challenging and dynamic.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card reveal">
    <h3>4. Syllabus Comparison</h3>
    <p><b>JEE Main Syllabus:</b> Closely aligned with NCERT textbooks of classes 11 & 12 with fewer out-of-scope topics. 
      The focus remains on accuracy, formula application, and speed.</p>
    <p><b>JEE Advanced Syllabus:</b> Includes deeper and wider concepts, especially in Physics and Mathematics. 
      It demands excellent command over topics like mechanics, calculus, organic chemistry mechanisms, and advanced problem patterns.</p>
    <p>Students aiming for Advanced must go beyond NCERT and practice application-oriented questions regularly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card full reveal">
    <h3>Which Exam Is Harder?</h3>
    <p><b>JEE Advanced</b> is significantly harder due to:
      <ul>
        <li>Complex, multi-step questions</li>
        <li>Unpredictable pattern every year</li>
        <li>Negative marking for multiple-correct answers</li>
        <li>Higher conceptual depth</li>
        <li>A competitive pool consisting of the top 2.5 lakh students from JEE Main</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>JEE Main</b> focuses more on conceptual clarity, formula-based solutions, and speed-oriented practice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card full reveal">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>To excel in <b>JEE Main</b>, students should prioritize NCERT mastery, timed mock tests, and consistent practice of previous-year questions.</p>
    <p>For <b>JEE Advanced</b>, aspirants must strengthen problem-solving skills, develop mathematical intuition, practice multi-concept questions, 
      and build deep conceptual understanding.</p>
    <p>With the right coaching, consistent revision, and a well-planned strategy, students can crack both exams and achieve their dream of entering India’s top engineering institutes.</p>
